# The first JS game : Tabby's journey


Hello! This is the very first 2D JS game 👾 that  I've had made during 2 weeks!
This is a quite simple game.  
All you have to do is just help Tabby🐱 to finish his errands while avoiding the obstacles!💣

This project helps me to explore some cool concepts such as the canvas, double-dimensions arrays and game tools.💡
